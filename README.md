# Parameterized Excel reports 

## Introduction

This repo demonstrates how to generate an Excel report using randomly generated data/column names/branch location names. The data used in this script is randomly generated and does not represent any real financial data. It is intended to demonstrate how to manipulate data in R and create an Excel report. This repo was inspired by [Parameterized reporting](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) in RMarkdown.

## Installation

To run this script, you will need to have R installed on your computer along with the required packages openxlsx and dplyr. You can install the required packages using the following code:
 
 ```
 install.packages("openxlsx")
 install.packages("dplyr")
 ```
